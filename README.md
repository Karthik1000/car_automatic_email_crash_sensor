# car_automatic_email_crash_sensor-using-arduino
Hi friends, <br>
<b>Here this project is about automatic_email_crash_sensor using arduino. This project is known to everyone and 
you can see more infomation on internet.

Description :<br>
Vehicle accidents are one of the leading causes of fatalities. Because of not getting help on time, poor emergency
facilities, people lose their lives. This project deals with the optimum solution to this drawback. An automatic alarm
device for vehicle accidents is introduced in this paper. The vehicular module is used to detect vehicle accident. An
accelerometer can be used in a car alarm application so that dangerous driving can be detected. It can be used as a crash
or rollover detector of the vehicle during and after a crash. With signals from an accelerometer, a severe accident can
be recognized. The vehicular module can search for the accident spot and then send the basic information to first aid
center and police station within few seconds covering geographical coordinates where the accident had taken place. By
means of satellite navigation system, first aid rescuers, police too can accurately locate the place so that they can save
the injured people as soon as possible.
